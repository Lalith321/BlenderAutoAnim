# BlenderAutoAnim

The complete set of movements here seem to have moved to fast and thus it appears to be a glitch and as the time passes the rig and anim forms an un natural shape/pose.
This might be due to lesser convolution samples which also corresponds to bigger windows. This might give us a largely differentiating values. Having a large distance between each keyframe of animation while the time difference is less or same tends to speedup the entire animation.

Below is a pose from one of the videos that closely resembles a dance move that has negligible errors.
